# CampusShootingSimulation

## Motivation

This project aims to simulate the Campus Shooting in an virtual environment. The killer is supposed to kill students **Indiscriminately**.

## Students

We suppose that students know the campus well, so they are able to run directly to the exit of each environment. Additionally, they can choose to hide rather than escape.

## Killer

Killer's aim is pretty simple: kill as more as possible

## TODO and LOG:

Till now, all action tests are done. Test scenes are created.
New branch is created to apply q-learning on it.
+ For more detail, see LOG.md

## FINALLY

**GOOD LUCK AND HAVE A NICE DAY**
