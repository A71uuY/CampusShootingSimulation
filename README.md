# CampusShootingSimulation

## Motivation

This project aims to simulate the Campus Shooting in an virtual environment. The killer is supposed to kill students **Indiscriminately**.

## Students

We suppose that students know the campus well, so they are able to run directly to the exit of each environment. Additionally, they can choose to hide rather than escape.

## Killer

Killer's aim is pretty simple: kill as more as possible

## TODO and LOG:

March 10: Usable environment established. There are still few bugs in the pathfinding function for students.

**TODO**: Decision making for killer and students.

**TODO**: Make the killer cleverer. Use strategies to take place of the *random walking*.

**TODO**: Ensure that students won't stuck at a pathway or corner. They shall be able to give way to others after few seconds of stuck.

***

March 11: Hide behavior for students. Add *hideout* attribute for nodes. Students will directly hide once they found a hideout.

**TODO**: Implement the influence of hiding students to the killer.

## FINALLY

**GOOD LUCK AND HAVE A NICE DAY**
